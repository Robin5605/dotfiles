# Dotfiles
My Arch Linux dotfiles can be found in this repository. Both for sharing with others and as a backup means. 

## Applications
The major applications that I use frequently I have included dotfiles for. They include:
    - [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator.
